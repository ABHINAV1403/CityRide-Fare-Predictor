CityRide-Fare-Predictor

This machine learning project estimates the cost of travel between various locations within Hyderabad, India. The system predicts fares for different types of vehicles, including cars, autos, and bikes, based on historical data of distances and fares between specific locations.
 
The model is trained on a dataset containing information about distances, durations, and corresponding fares for various routes within Hyderabad.

Features-
-Location-Based Fare Estimation: The system allows users to input any pickup and drop-off location within the city, and it provides an estimated fare for each type of vehicle.
-Distance and Fare Interpolation: For routes not explicitly present in the dataset, the system uses a nearest-neighbor approach to interpolate fares based on the closest known routes.
Extensible and Scalable: The system is designed to be extended with additional data or features, such as real-time traffic updates or dynamic pricing models or night charges.
